%        	Our project involves creating a rapid prototyping system in the field of Internet of Things that can be used by those with minimal technical experience, with specific focus on use in the field of agriculture.
%			This will take the form of modular hardware kits that can be programmed using a graphical interface so that the user never has to write a line of code. The reason that this is so useful is because of the current barriers to entry for Internet of Things type solutions greatly restrict the quantity of solutions being proposed. At the same time, Internet of Things related ideas have the potential to solve a large quantity of problems, but a lot of the population lacks the technical skills to enact these solutions even though they have the creativity to come up with them. 
%			By giving those without technical experience the ability to create and build their own solutions we are removing one of the barriers to entry to creating Internet of Things type solutions, resulting, in theory, in a greater number of problems being solved.

\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
	This document aims to elucidate the goals, scope, requirements, and development process of the software and hardware of Project LOOM. Project LOOM will be a modular suite of Internet of Things devices whose extensible and easy programmability expands the demographic of people capable of implementing Internet of Things solutions.
	\subsection{Scope}
	With Project LOOM, we aim to create an open-source, plug-and-play suite of modular building blocks that can be used by a user with limited technical expertise to create complex systems. We hope to broaden the range of people capable of implementing IoT projects by developing a system that abstracts out the more technical details consistent to any project.
	\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}
	The Internet of Things (IoT): 
	Entails an aggregate of embedded systems capable of reading, transmitting, receiving, processing, and acting upon data. This often takes the form of a network of remotely connected devices that can be used for the purpose of autonomous data collection, or remote control and automation of various systems. 
	Module:
	An interchangeable, self-contained device that can be connected to an IoT network with minimal configuration. Connects to other modules to combine behaviors (i.e. a sensor attached to a WiFi adapter becomes a sensor that transfers data over WiFi).
	Gateway:
	A wired or wireless node connecting multiple devices on a network (e.g. WiFi, Ethernet)
	Long-Range Wireless Radio Frequency (LoRa RF or just LoRa):
	A flavor of gateway 

	\subsection{References}
	List that Gantt chart exists (actual chart lives elsewhere)
	\subsection{Overview}
	The remainder of the document will provide more specific information regarding the functions and constraints of Project LOOM, as well as characteristics of its users and the assumptions and dependencies that are inherent to its inception. 

\section{Overall Description}
	\subsection{Product Perspective}
	The part of Project LOOM being worked on by Group 36 is merely a subset of the larger project that includes developing the graphical interface that will be used to program the kits as well as the embedded firmware that will be run on the devices themselves.

	\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
	The main user interface will be a module for MaxMSP that 
	\subsection{Product Functions}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The product must be able to receive and transmit data with physically and wirelessly connected modules.
		\item Users must be able to view the readings or actions of the connected modules via software
		\item Users must be able to remotely trigger events on actuators
		\item Users must be able to re-calibrate devices remotely
		\item Users must be able to program the devices with the Arduino development environment by altering or replicating the open-source code on which the firmware is based.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{User Characteristics}
	There are a range of possible users for the LOOM devices and software; the target audience is meant to span from novice hobbyists to experts. Anyone wanting to learn about or implement an IoT solution in a streamlined fashion should be able to pick it up out of the box and get a simple system working without any programming. On the other end of the spectrum, there are users with more technical expertise, who simply want well-designed sensors and actuators that work together in a way that make sense. Since Project LOOM is open-source, these users will be able to write their own software and firmware for the chips if they choose to do so.
	Project LOOM is currently being developed with the intent to be tested by university professors and their students.

	\subsection{Constraints}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Regulatory policies;
			\item Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);
			\item Interfaces to other applications;
			\item Parallel operation;
			\item Audit functions;
			\item Control functions;
			\item Higher-order language requirements;
				Signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);
			\item Reliability requirements;
					Will send notification if system has detected that a module is broken, offline, or otherwise less functional
					More can be added as stretch goals?
			\item Criticality of the application;
					Not an immediately critical system
			\item Safety and security considerations.
					Will be followed to a reasonable effort, but not to the point that it restricts progress of the rest of the project
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	Our work will be built off of the framework of the existing hardware and software of Project Loom. We are assuming that our firmware and software will be run on functional hardware developed by a sister team of Project Loom. The firmware for the modules in Project LOOM will be developed with the Arduino development environment, and the interface for reading the data will be a plugin for MaxMSP.

	\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}

\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interfaces}
\subsection{Functions}
Modules will be able to connect to a host via several different gateways: a serial connection, WiFi (using credentials flashed onto the chip), LoRa, and LAN. Modules shall take and send data at intervals set by the user, or on a pinged request. Any output behavior will be reflected in the behavior of an actuator module.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
Things like the maximum number of modules supported, latency ranges, operational range

\subsection{Design Constraints}
Things like the budget for each kit maybe?

\subsubsection{Reliability}
\subsubsection{Security}
\subsubsection{Maintenance}
